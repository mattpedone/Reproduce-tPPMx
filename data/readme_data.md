## Scenarios - Train-Test 

Data stored in files `scena1a.RData`-`scena3b.RData` are analysed in the main simulation study reported in the paper. These data can be generated running lines 1-31 in the script `R/genscen.R`. 

### overlap = 1.0
1. 2 prognostic and 25 predictive markers. 
It is stored in `scen1a.RData`

2. 2 prognostic and 50 predictive markers. 
It is stored in `scen1b.RData`

### overlap = 0.9
3. 2 prognostic and 25 predictive markers. 
It is stored in `scen2a.RData`

4. 2 prognostic and 50 predictive markers. 
It is stored in `scen2b.RData`

### overlap = 0.8
5. 2 prognostic and 25 predictive markers. 
It is stored in `scen3a.RData`

6. 2 prognostic and 50 predictive markers. 
It is stored in `scen3b.RData`

## Lower Grade Glioma

* `LGGdata.rda` is the version analysed in BiomJ

## Scenarios Linear (Supplementary) - Train-Test 

Data stored in files `scena1aL.RData`-`scena3bL.RData` are analysed in the simulation study reported in the Supplementary Material B2. These data can be generated running lines 33-56 in the script `R/genscen.R` (once the seed has been correctly set).
