## Reproduction of Results in "A Bayesian nonparametric approach to personalized treatment selection"

This repository contains an R project that is used to reproduce the results in "A Bayesian nonparametric approach to personalized treatment selection".

The project is structured as follows:

    .
    ├── data                  # contains the datasets used in the paper
    ├── figs                  # contains the figures in paper and supplementary material
    ├── LGG-data-analysis     # contains the script for the LGG data analysis
    ├── output                # contains the results of the simulation studies and those of the case study
    ├── R                     # contains the R scripts used to analyze the data and reproduce the results in the paper
    ├── code_requirements.R   # contains the list of R packages necessary to run the R scripts in`R` and `LGG-data-analysis`
    └── README.md

To reproduce the results in the paper, please follow the steps below:

-   Clone this repository to your local machine.
-   Install the necessary R packages listed in `code_requirements.R`.
-   Set the working directory to the root of the project.
-   Run the R script.

Note that each folder in this repository contains a readme file to describe the purpose and the elements in the folder. Please note that the amount of computational resources needed and the time required to reproduce the results may vary depending on the specific machine being used.
